# Contributing to LogLens

Thanks for your interest in improving LogLens! This document covers how to set
up a development environment, run the checks, and submit changes.

## Development setup

LogLens targets **Python 3.11+**.

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/adityabhatt/loglens.git
cd loglens

# Install in editable mode with all optional features + dev tools
pip install -e '.[web,opensearch,xlsx,claude,embed,dev]'
```

The optional extras are independent — for most work `.[dev,web]` is enough. The
full set above is only needed when touching the OpenSearch, xlsx, Claude or
embedding code paths.

## Running the checks

CI runs three things on Linux, Windows and macOS (Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 and
3.14). Run them locally before opening a pull request:

```bash
pytest                  # test suite
ruff check .            # linter
ruff format --check .   # formatting
```

`ruff format .` (without `--check`) applies the formatting. All ruff
configuration lives in `pyproject.toml`.

To check pipeline throughput (parse + PII-redact + rule engine) and catch
performance regressions:

```bash
python scripts/benchmark.py --lines 100000
```

### Known test warning

`pytest` emits one upstream deprecation warning:

```
StarletteDeprecationWarning: Using `httpx` with `starlette.testclient` is
deprecated; install `httpx2` instead.
```

It comes from Starlette's `TestClient` at import time, not from LogLens's own
code, and is harmless. We do **not** depend on `httpx2` yet because it is not
generally available across our supported Python versions; once Starlette and the
ecosystem settle on it, we'll migrate. You can safely ignore this warning.

## Code style

- Line length 99, double quotes — enforced by `ruff format`.
- Type hints throughout; modules use `from __future__ import annotations`.
- Keep the core library (`loglens/`) free of CLI/HTTP concerns — see
  Architecture below.

## Architecture

LogLens follows a **library-first** design:

- `loglens/` is a pure Python library — all analysis logic lives here.
- `loglens/cli/` (Typer) and `loglens/web/` (FastAPI) are thin wrappers that
  call the library; they contain no analysis logic of their own.
- The **PII redactor runs directly after parsing** — no downstream component
  (rules, stats, LLM, storage) ever sees raw PII.
- Storage goes through the repository pattern in `loglens/storage/`.

New analysis features belong in the library; the CLI and web layers only
expose them.

```

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repository and create a branch off `master`.
2. Make your change; add or update tests to cover it.
3. Make sure `pytest`, `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .` all pass.
4. Open a pull request against `master` with a clear description of what
   changed and why.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Use the issue templates — they prompt for the details needed to act on a
report. For security vulnerabilities, **do not open a public issue**; see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
