# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Parsers:** Apache error log (classic 2.2 and 2.4 layouts, with log-level →
  severity mapping) and HAProxy HTTP log (syslog-prefix aware), both
  auto-detected. Apache *access* logs already parse via the combined-log parser.
- **Alert channels:** a `notify` subsystem with Slack, Discord, generic-webhook
  and e-mail (SMTP) notifiers. Configure any number under an `alerts:` section in
  `config.yaml`, each with its own `min_severity`; they fire on every realtime
  command automatically. `${ENV_VAR}` expansion keeps secrets out of the file.
- **`loglens alerts` CLI:** `alerts list` (show configured channels, secrets
  masked) and `alerts test` (send a sample finding to every channel).
- **Alert throttling:** an optional per-channel `cooldown` (seconds) suppresses
  repeats of the same finding (`rule_id` + `source`) within the window, taming
  alert storms. Only successful deliveries arm the timer.
- This changelog.
- CI test matrix now covers Python 3.13 and 3.14 (in addition to 3.11 and 3.12)
  on Linux, Windows and macOS; added the matching trove classifiers.
- CONTRIBUTING note documenting the harmless upstream `httpx`/`httpx2`
  Starlette `TestClient` deprecation warning.

### Changed
- The realtime alert path now routes through the `notify` dispatcher. The legacy
  `--alert-webhook` flag is unchanged and fires alongside configured channels.

### Fixed
- Use the non-deprecated `HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_CONTENT` status constant in the
  event-ingest endpoint (silences a FastAPI/Starlette deprecation warning).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-12

A connectivity & extensibility release: six new log sources, two new parsers, and
a plugin system that can register parsers and adapters.

### Added
- **Source adapters:** Kubernetes (pod logs via `kubectl`), Windows Event Log
  (JSON export + live tailing), S3 / object storage (via the `aws` CLI), syslog
  listener (UDP/TCP, RFC 3164 & 5424), AWS CloudWatch Logs, GCP Cloud Logging.
- **Parsers:** logfmt (`key=value`) with format auto-detection; CEF / LEEF for
  security appliances.
- **Plugins** can now register custom parsers and source adapters, in addition to
  rules and PII patterns.
- A source-adapter registry as the single source of truth for adapter wiring.
- Structured `.xlsx` log parsing (header-row detection, typed columns).
- Full test coverage for the stdin and tail adapters (945 tests total).

### Changed
- Extracted an `HttpPollingAdapter` base class for HTTP-based sources.

### Fixed
- German phone-number PII pattern no longer matches date/time fragments.

### Docs
- Corrected README inaccuracies (rule operators, built-in rule IDs/severities, PII
  pattern list, LLM API-key environment variables).
- Added a troubleshooting note explaining why scans only appear in the dashboard
  when persisted with `--track-errors`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Read `.xlsx` log files natively instead of garbling them as text.

### Changed
- Dropped the non-functional EVTX parser stub.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- `Principal` abstraction in the web auth layer.

### Changed
- Numerous internal refactors: shared `SqliteRepository` base, `tail_pipeline`
  helper, `build_engine()`, `parse_lookback` time-spec helper, consolidated
  severity ordering, single `BUILTIN_RULES_DIR` constant.

### Fixed
- PII `dry-run` mode now truly leaves the text unchanged.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Fleet** feature: scan/tail many targets at once — `fleet init` wizard,
  `fleet scan` (concurrent fan-out), `fleet tail` (realtime merge), `fleet list`
  (reachability check), browser-based config editor, dashboard target filter, and
  per-target persistence in SQLite.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Source adapters: Loki, Graylog, SSH remote host, systemd journald, Docker
  (scan + realtime tail), and OpenSearch realtime polling.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Web dashboard (`loglens serve`), REST API v1, Docker packaging, log-file upload
  page, false-positive suppression, Markdown export, and the plugin system.
