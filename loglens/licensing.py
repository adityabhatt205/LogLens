"""Detection seam for the optional commercial ``loglens-enterprise`` add-on.

The open-source core never imports or depends on ``loglens_enterprise``.
This module is the single place where the core may discover whether the
enterprise add-on is installed — any future premium feature gate goes
through here.

When the add-on is absent (the standard case) every function degrades to a
safe default: the core runs with its full open-source feature set and
nothing is restricted. Installing the add-on may only ever *add*
capabilities, never change or remove core behaviour.
